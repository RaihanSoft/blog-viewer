# Next.js Kinde Authentication Example

This project demonstrates how to build a simple Next.js application with authentication using [Kinde Auth](https://kinde.com). It includes a protected profile page that fetches user details, with automatic redirection for unauthenticated users.

## Features

- **Dynamic Authentication**: Users are automatically redirected to the login page if not authenticated.
- **Protected Profile Page**: Displays user details like email, username, and more, fetched via Kinde.
- **Kinde Integration**: Securely handles authentication and user data with Kinde's SDK.
